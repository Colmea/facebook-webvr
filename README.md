# WebVR Facebook

This repository is an experiment for a web Facebook world in 3D with React.js, Three.js and WebVR technology with Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard and HTC Vive (well, when I have the device). 

## How it works

webvr-fb is a full (es6) Javascript app and uses theses technologies:
* React.js
* Three.js (with [react-three-renderer](https://github.com/toxicFork/react-three-renderer) package)
* CSS3D with the React HTML3D component (see my [react-three-renderer-html3d](https://github.com/Colmea/react-three-renderer-html3d) package)
* Alt.js (Flux library)

## Work in progress

This repository is still a work in progress:

* [x] React + Three.js environment
* [x] HTML3D component (CSS3D transformation in a React component)
* [ ] Alt.js structure
* [ ] Facebook API
* [ ] Facebook's Post, Video, Comment and Notifications
* [ ] WebVR
